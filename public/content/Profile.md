## About
Hi, Iâ€™m Sajida Javed. Iâ€™m a web developer who enjoys creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. I work with PHP, Laravel, React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, and MySQL. Iâ€™ve also participated in hackathons and speed programming competitions where I ranked among the top, which helped me grow as a developer. Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies, take on new challenges. If youâ€™re working on something interesting or need a developer who loves bringing ideas to life, Iâ€™d love to connect.
