## About
Hi, Iâ€™m Sajida Javed. Iâ€™m a web developer who enjoys creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. I love building real-world solutions that are both functional and visually appealing.

I work with PHP, Laravel, React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, and MySQL. I also have experience with REST APIs, custom styling, and responsive design. Some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on include a real estate management system using Vue.js and Laravel, a photography website for Javed Studio built with Next.js and custom landing pages, and a dynamic multi-step form created in React.

Iâ€™ve also participated in hackathons and speed programming competitions where I ranked among the top, which helped me grow as a developer and strengthened my ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently.

Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies, take on new challenges, and collaborate with others to create meaningful digital experiences. If youâ€™re working on something interesting or need a developer who loves bringing ideas to life, Iâ€™d love to connect.
